| 01    | Chosen architecture characteristics: cost, interoperability, simplicity, fault-tolerance, and evolvability | Prioritized cost, interoperability, simplicity, fault-tolerance, and evolvability based on problem statement.                                                                  | May require trade-offs between simplicity and evolvability over time, potentially limiting flexibility as requirements grow.                                                                                                                                                                                  | <a href="adr/adr01.md">ADR01</a> |
| 02    | Service-Based Architecture selected                                                                        | Service-based architecture chosen to align with prioritized characteristics (cost, fault-tolerance, scalability).                                                              | Increased complexity in service orchestration and operational overhead compared to a monolithic approach. This level of complexity is needed to allow enough evolvability of system. Reduced scalability compared to microservices of event-driven architecture to optimize more for cost and expected scale. | <a href="adr/adr02.md">ADR02</a> |
| 03    | Organize components per domain                                                                             | Organizes ClearView components into domain-specific groups (candidate, employer, matching, etc.) to separate concerns effectively and improve maintainability and testability. | Requires managing inter-domain communication and potentially increasing complexity if domains grow interdependent.                                                                                                                                                                                            | <a href="adr/adr03.md">ADR03</a> |
| 04    | Unified API with multiple endpoints                                                                        | Simplifies architecture by having a single API with various endpoints for different functionalities.                                                                           | Can lead to large, complex APIs over time, making it harder to maintain clear boundaries between services. Reducing number of API services to one instead of multiple (one for each domain).                                                                                                                  | <a href="adr/adr04.md">ADR04</a> |
| 05    | One relational database and one file-storage DB                                                            | Simplifies maintenance by reducing the number of databases, combining multiple domains into one relational DB.                                                                 | Resumes need separate file storage.	May compromise modularity and separation of concerns between domains, leading to potential scaling or data management challenges later. However big scalability is not expected so we feel comfortable in making this decision.                                           | <a href="adr/adr05.md">ADR05</a> |
| 06    | Split database by schema to decouple domains and improve security                                          | Improves fault-tolerance and security by separating candidate, employer, matching, and analytics data into schemas.                                                            | More complex database management, requiring careful handling of schema-specific optimizations and inter-schema queries.                                                                                                                                                                                       | <a href="adr/adr06.md">ADR06</a> |
| 07    | Analytics as part of regular database                                                                      | Simplifies architecture by embedding analytics within the regular database, avoiding real-time analytics complexity.                                                           | May limit future analytics capabilities if real-time or advanced analytics are needed, and could add extra load to the operational database. However, it should be fairly easy to move this data to separate database if needed.                                                                              | <a href="adr/adr07.md">ADR07</a> |
| 08    | Split Anonymization, AI tips and matching services                                                         | Decouples Anonymization, AI tips and matching services, making the system simpler and easier to scale independently.                                                           | Requires coordination between services and careful orchestration of dependencies if they need to interact, adding complexity in integration. On the other hand we improve separation of concerns, maintaining and testability.                                                                                | <a href="adr/adr08.md">ADR08</a> |
| 09    | Matching once per Job Ad deadline                                                                          | Matches candidates once per job ad deadline, aligning with employer expectations and simplifying processing pipelines.                                                         | Delays real-time candidate matching and feedback loops, making the system less responsive to changes in candidate or job availability during the job lifecycle. However, it dramatically reduces costs of processing. If needed, processing can be invoked through Matching API on demand.                    | <a href="adr/adr09.md">ADR09</a> |
| 10    | Configurable top N candidates for employers                                                                | Allows employers to see the top N candidates, making "N" configurable, ensuring scalability and reducing DB overload.                                                          | Complexity in configuring "N" dynamically across jobs; potential risk if "N" is set too high or too low for specific job listings, affecting employer satisfaction.                                                                                                                                           | <a href="adr/adr10.md">ADR10</a> |
| 11    | Use lightweight authentication (OAuth2, Shiro)                                                             | Implements simple and lightweight authentication to reduce complexity while securing access to services.                                                                       | May require upgrades to a more robust solution if security or user management needs increase, adding migration overhead later.                                                                                                                                                                                | <a href="adr/adr11.md">ADR11</a> |
| 12    | Use Third party solution for Survey and Payment                                                            | There are good existing solutions for this problem so we can reuse and reduce costs.                                                                                           | Hard to customize and extend, but no maintenance and cost is low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <a href="adr/adr12.md">ADR12</a> |
