### ADR 12: Use Third-Party Solution for Survey and Payment

- **Title**: Use Third-Party Solution for Survey and Payment
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**:  
  ClearView requires functionality to manage **surveys** for collecting feedback from candidates and employers, as well as a **payment system** for handling transactions related to premium services or employer subscriptions. Instead of building custom survey and payment systems, which would require additional development, maintenance, and operational overhead, we will leverage existing **third-party solutions** that are well-established in the market. These third-party services offer robust, scalable, and secure solutions at a lower cost compared to in-house development. By opting for third-party services, ClearView can focus on core functionality while outsourcing non-core services like surveys and payments.

- **Decision**:  
  ClearView will use **third-party solutions** for both **survey management** and **payment processing**:
  1. **Survey Management**: A third-party service (e.g., **SurveyMonkey**, **Google Forms**, or **Typeform**) will be integrated into the system for collecting feedback from users. These platforms provide user-friendly interfaces, data analysis, and automation features that meet ClearView’s needs.
  2. **Payment Processing**: A third-party payment gateway (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Square**) will be used to handle all transactions. These platforms offer secure, reliable, and compliant payment processing with minimal setup and maintenance required.

  Using third-party solutions for both survey and payment functionality reduces development time and operational costs, allowing the ClearView team to focus on building and optimizing core services.

- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**:
    - **Cost-Efficient**: Leveraging third-party services for surveys and payments reduces development costs, as these solutions come with minimal upfront costs and offer flexible pricing based on usage.
    - **No Maintenance**: Third-party providers manage the maintenance, updates, and security of their platforms, eliminating the burden of ongoing maintenance for ClearView.
    - **Faster Time to Market**: Integrating with third-party services accelerates the implementation of survey and payment functionalities, allowing ClearView to deliver these features without the time investment required for custom development.
    - **Security and Compliance**: Third-party payment providers, such as Stripe and PayPal, handle compliance with financial regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS), ensuring that ClearView does not need to manage sensitive payment data directly.
    - **Scalability**: These third-party platforms are built to scale with the needs of growing businesses, meaning ClearView can rely on them to handle increasing volumes of surveys or transactions as the user base grows.

  - **Negative**:
    - **Limited Customization**: Using third-party solutions may limit customization options, especially if ClearView requires specific survey or payment features that the chosen provider does not support. Integrating custom workflows or extending the functionality of these platforms can be challenging.
    - **Vendor Lock-In**: Relying on third-party providers introduces the risk of vendor lock-in, where switching to another provider or building an in-house solution could incur significant costs or development effort.
    - **Potential Lack of Integration Flexibility**: Depending on the third-party service, integrating with ClearView’s existing systems may not always be seamless, potentially requiring custom middleware or API calls to ensure data flows smoothly between the services.
    - **Data Privacy Considerations**: Survey data will be stored on third-party servers, which introduces potential concerns around data privacy and ownership. Payment providers will manage sensitive financial data, and while secure, this places trust in the vendor’s data protection policies.
    - **Harder to Extend**: If ClearView’s needs evolve (e.g., requiring custom payment features or advanced survey analytics), it may be difficult or impossible to extend the functionality of third-party solutions without switching to a more customizable or in-house solution.
