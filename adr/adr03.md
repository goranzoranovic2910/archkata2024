### ADR 03: Organize Components per Domain

- **Title**: Organize components per domain
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**:  
  ClearViewâ€™s system needs to manage several key functionalities, including candidate management, employer management, job matching, and administrative tasks. Each of these functionalities represents distinct areas of business logic that should be developed, maintained, and scaled independently. By organizing the system into domain-specific components, we can effectively separate concerns, improving maintainability, testability, and scalability over time. This decision aligns with the overall goal of creating a modular, flexible architecture that evolves with the system's needs.

- **Decision**:  
  ClearView components will be organized into the following **domain-specific groups**:
  1. **Candidate Domain**: Manages candidate profiles, resumes, skill extraction, and applications.
  2. **Employer Domain**: Handles employer accounts, job postings, and job application management.
  3. **Matching Domain**: Responsible for matching candidate skills with job descriptions, utilizing services like skill extraction and job recommendation.
  4. **Administrator Domain**: Handles system administration tasks such as marking candidates as hired, managing user data, and accessing reporting and analytics.
  5. **Reporting Domain**: Manages data aggregation, analysis, and reporting functionality for system performance, matching success rates, and business insights.
  6. **Survey Domain**: Collects feedback from candidates and employers to evaluate the system and improve the user experience.
  
  By organizing the system into these domain-specific components, we ensure that each domain is encapsulated, allowing independent development, testing, and scaling.

- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**:
    - **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Organizing components into domains ensures that business logic related to candidates, employers, and matching is kept separate, reducing the likelihood of entanglement and improving maintainability.
    - **Enhanced Testability**: Each domain can be tested independently, which simplifies unit and integration testing, increasing overall system reliability.
    - **Scalability**: Domains can be scaled independently based on their specific needs (e.g., candidate management may require more resources as user traffic increases).
    - **Domain-Specific Evolution**: Each domain can evolve independently, allowing for targeted improvements and updates without affecting unrelated domains.
    - **Modularity**: This structure promotes modularity, making it easier to onboard new team members or shift responsibilities between teams.

  - **Negative**:
    - **Increased Complexity**: Managing multiple domains may increase complexity, particularly in handling inter-domain communication (e.g., how the candidate domain communicates with the matching domain). This complexity grows as the system evolves and more domains or subdomains are introduced.
    - **Interdependencies**: As the system scales, domains may become interdependent, requiring additional infrastructure (e.g., message queues, APIs) to manage the communication between domains, which could introduce latency and operational overhead.
    - **Potential Overhead in Orchestration**: Coordinating domain-specific services and ensuring that data is consistent across domains might require more sophisticated service orchestration tools and practices.
