### ADR 01: Chosen Architecture Characteristics for ClearView

- **Title**: Chosen architecture characteristics: cost, interoperability, simplicity, fault-tolerance, and evolvability
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**:  
  ClearView aims to create a system that reduces bias in job candidate selection by anonymizing CVs and matching candidates to job advertisements. To ensure that the system is sustainable and effective, we need to prioritize the architectural characteristics that align with our long-term goals. The chosen characteristics should not only address immediate technical requirements but also ensure the system is adaptable and cost-effective as it grows.

- **Decision**:  
  The following architecture characteristics have been prioritized based on ClearView's goals and problem statement:
  1. **Cost**: The architecture should be designed with cost-efficiency in mind, keeping both development and operational costs low.
  2. **Interoperability**: ClearView must integrate seamlessly with existing HR systems, job boards, and other third-party platforms, ensuring smooth data exchange and compatibility.
  3. **Simplicity**: The system should prioritize simplicity in design to ensure that it remains maintainable and scalable, with clear and understandable workflows.
  4. **Fault-Tolerance**: The architecture must be able to handle failures gracefully, ensuring that critical components remain operational even in the event of issues with other parts of the system.
  5. **Evolvability**: The system should be able to evolve over time, allowing for new features and services to be added without major architectural rework.

- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**:
    - **Cost**: By prioritizing cost, the system can scale in a financially sustainable manner, avoiding expensive overengineering.
    - **Interoperability**: ClearViewâ€™s ability to integrate with existing HR systems ensures wide adoption and usability in real-world scenarios.
    - **Simplicity**: Focusing on simplicity ensures that ClearView is easier to develop, maintain, and extend. This will lead to a more maintainable codebase and reduced operational complexity.
    - **Fault-Tolerance**: Building fault-tolerance into the architecture increases system reliability, reducing downtime and improving user experience.
    - **Evolvability**: A focus on evolvability ensures that the system remains flexible and adaptable to changing business needs, allowing for easier feature expansion in the future.

  - **Negative**:
    - **Simplicity vs. Evolvability**: While simplicity is beneficial for maintainability, it may come at the cost of evolvability. Over time, simple designs may need refactoring or architectural changes as new features and requirements arise, which can lead to increased technical debt.
    - **Balancing Cost**: Cost-efficiency may limit the use of more advanced features or technologies, potentially impacting the system's ability to adopt cutting-edge solutions. This could also lead to performance limitations or reduced functionality in specific areas.
    - **Interoperability Challenges**: Ensuring interoperability can introduce complexity when integrating with diverse external systems, which may require additional effort for maintaining APIs and compatibility with third-party platforms.
